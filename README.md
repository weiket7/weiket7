### About Me

Hello! My name is Wei Ket, a self-taught full stack developer in Singapore. I love coding because we can build products which solve problems and help people. To improve code quality and reduce technical debt, I emphasise on refactoring to code smells and design principles and writing unit and integration tests. I'm meticulous and practical with a growth mindset.
